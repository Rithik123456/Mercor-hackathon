Chatbot Development & Deployment Hackathon
Welcome to the Chatbot Development & Deployment Hackathon! In this exciting challenge, participants have the opportunity to create innovative and user-friendly chatbots that fulfill real-user needs. This hackathon encourages you to unleash your creativity and leverage advanced features such as GPT's function calling to take your chatbot beyond typical conversation models.

Introduction
Challenge Overview
Objective: Construct a chatbot that provides value to users by fulfilling their real-world needs.

Tech Stack: We'll be using TextBase, a user-friendly chatbot UI, which simplifies the frontend development, allowing you to focus on the core functionalities.

Deployment Dashboard: We've introduced a new deployment dashboard that streamlines the deployment process, making it easy to deploy your creations.

Getting Started
Star the TextBase Repository: As a requirement of this hackathon, please star the TextBase repository at https://github.com/cofactoryai/textbase.

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to get started with your chatbot development.

System Prompt: Modify the system prompt to define the behavior and purpose of your chatbot. This is where you set the context for your chatbot's interactions.

Examples
Here are some examples from previous Mercor Chatbot Challenges to inspire you:

Product Recommender: Create a recommendation chatbot that gathers user preferences, asks relevant follow-up questions, and suggests products by searching through a database. Utilize function calling for the database search component.

Distress Signal Bot: Develop a bot designed to provide immediate support in distress situations. When it detects an emergency via text input, it activates an audio recording feature and sends the captured audio, along with a transcript, directly to an emergency contact through Twilio. Ensure precision in prompt design and stringent safeguards for responsible and prompt action in critical situations.
